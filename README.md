## How It's Made:

  **Languages used:**  HTML, CSS, JavaScript

  - Made a function that randomly chooses string values of rock, paper, or scissors for both the player and the bot. It then compares those two randomly picked string values and determined the winner. The player is notified with a message if they won or not.

## Optimizations
  - Better game Design
  - IMPROVE syntax consistently
  
## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
